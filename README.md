It's a system that has the goal of helping manage books which the student can request/have for up to 2 books while the admin acts as librarian managing the requests and
adding/removing books of the system.
There is a registration system to signup/login which the name and password need at least 4 characters, and the email 12.

The first user is considered the admin because of id 1.
There's only one of each book, so if the admin accepts one of the requests of book A and more than one student requested this book, the rest of requests will be deleted as well.
